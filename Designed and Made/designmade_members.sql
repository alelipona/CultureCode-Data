All my work starts life as a blank piece of paper, and I make a wide range of pieces, from one-off unique books where everything is hand cut with a scalpel and then bound, to limited editions and multiples, using machine cutting in my studio from an hand-drawn or hand-cut original. Drawing is at the heart of my practice, and I take inspiration from the landscape around me as well as from particular texts and films.</p> <p>The inspiration for many of my current pieces comes from a 1945 film called ''I Know Where I''m Going''. My unique books often relate to a particular character in the film and contain the words that character speaks; bits of the script also trickle into other work, snippets of dialogue, forming and reforming, taking on new meanings and telling different stories.  I also use half-remembered lines of songs and poems so that text forms an integral part of many of my pieces, shaping their form in the process.

The designs are heavily influenced by Polly&rsquo;s cultural heritage, from both her Danish ancestry and her British roots. This fusion of cultural perspectives results in chic, contemporary, innovative pieces, designed for longevity whilst retaining a fresh take on modern living.</p> <p>Polly explores elements of past trends in her work, updating traditional designs for contemporary living, drawing on the influences of historical pieces and examining the ways in which these designs can be re-invented to function in today&rsquo;s interiors. This is evident with the Klasse Wing Back lounge chair, based on the iconic British &lsquo;wing back&rsquo; design. The wing back chair was originally designed to guard the user&rsquo;s face and upper body from drafts in old houses, and to add protection from the heat of the roaring fire. The sleek finish and exaggerated form of the Klasse Wing Back, combined with the natural materials used, ensures a contemporary, eye-catching adaptation of this classic piece.</p> <p>Polly was born in South East London, leaving the capital to study Three Dimensional Design in the North East at Northumbria University. She has remained in Newcastle and is now part of a thriving new design community. Having spent two years initiating new products under the university&rsquo;s Design in Residence scheme, Polly is continuing to grow and develop the westergaard designs brand.</p>', 'Fun/Energetic/Nostalgic/Contemporary/Scandinavian/Inspiring /Clean/Stimulating/Innovative/Bespoke/Quirky/Creative/Funky/Original/Diverse/Playful/Distinctive/Individual/Unique/Functional/ ', 'British and Scandinavian heritage./Arne Jacobsen/Scandinavian Designs/Nature/Simple forms/Combining of 2D graphics with 3D objects./Nostalgia/Simplistic forms/Made in England/Forests of Norway/The child within'),
