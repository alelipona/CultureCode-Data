• Over 2000 authoritative entries and 400 illustrations, including diagrams for comprehensive treatment of architectural terms\
• Covers painting, sculpture, architecture, photography, the decorative, applied and graphic arts from all periods throughout the world up to the present day: there is even a table of the dynasties of Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt, China, India \
and Japan\
• This new edition features entries connected with the use of computer technology in the art world and includes today’s influential groups and tendencies\
This dictionary is compact, because our experience of the arts is gained in so many places – in exhibitions, in museums, touring with a guide book – and no one wants to tour with a reference library. It is also comprehensive, because neither in real life nor in books are the various arts neatly segregated. More than 2000 entries therefore define and explain terms from painting, sculpture, architecture, the decorative and applied arts… \
With this dictionary at hand, the reader should be able to puzzle out any art text, however technical, and the collector or exhibition-goer should feel at ease with any auction or museum catalogue, no matter how recondite.","Apr 07 stock check - still part of library stock","",""

Rather than confining the century to a year-by-year narrative, the author Bernard Blistene - one of France's leading curators and art historians - has compiled an up-beat book, presenting the principal tendencies, movements and figureheads of twentieth-century art in a series of thematically organized chapters. The author presents the essential contributions of movements from the early part of the century, including Fauvism, Cubism, Dada, Expressionism, and Surrealism, but also looks at the return to Classicism after the First World War; the parallel development of American and European art from the 1950s onwards; and the evolution of architecture over the decades. Also vital to this new account are arts other than painting and sculpture - design, photography, cinema and video - which played such a pivotal role through the century. ","","","Cat?\

Closely informed by critical approaches, this book sets out to provide the first concise interpretation of this period. Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Cindy Sherman, and Damien Hirst are among many artists discussed, within the political and cultural worlds they inhabited. The theoretical and issue-based debates that have driven the art of this period art along are followed through the key movements of Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, Minimalism, Conceptualism, Postmodernism. This book is intended as an introduction to art in the latter half of the 20th Century for students and the general reader interested in modern and contemporary art. ","","",""

In her discussion of feminism and its influence on such a reappraisal, the author also addresses the closely related issues of ethnicity, class, and sexuality.\
\
This expanded edition is brought up to date in the light of the most recent developments in contemporary art. A new chapter considers how women’s art in the twenty-first century is characterized by a renewed focus on the personal and the intimate, alongside an interest in more global issues. Chadwick also discusses some of the ways recent women artists have revisited and at times subverted earlier feminist strategies.","","",""

To highlight the many seminal exhibitions produced by the institution, the Museum solicited loans of works of art from both public and private collections in Houston that had been introduced to their owners by the Museum.

 FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS explores the multiple possibilities of conviviality between artists of different generations, various countries and diverse aesthetic positions. Today as the hierarchies between the arts fade away, the notions of center and periphery start to be put into question; we can celebrate the resulting dispersion of artistic energies: there is not a single hegemonic trend that imposes its particular truth over the others; multiple narratives are emerging and we are learning to respect the place of others while we try to create common areas of encounter. The best contemporary art seeks to construct dialogical relations with the viewers; artists are not proposing eternal truths but rather ephemeral events, personal views, or process centred experiences. This can be considered a weak response to the pervasive globalisation of transnational capitalism that imposes a single model of thought and consumerism. These paradoxes provoke in us both fascination and fear. In this context, to be friends or collaborative neighbours can help us face many of those contradictions and awaken in us our capacity for critical thought.","","",""

It does so with art which refuses to provide an alibi. Art not for decorating, apologising or glossing over, but for never giving up hope and never giving in. Because reality also holds answers and solutions, if you only choose to see them. The Biennial will show work by 27 artists from all over the world. They work indifferent ways, but share an attitude: they love life and firmly reject everything that is vapid, uniform and stagnant. And they don't shy away from moving you by shocking you. So treat yourself to some unreality escapism. You've got all summer. ","","",""

In two words it gives us an idea of what it is all about. First after a few seconds, when we realise that neither the body nor its actions are independant of their surroundings, does the full complexity come clear. The body in action is aesthetic, as it has devoured what itself holds to be natural; organic movement, metabolism, procreation. The acting body does not, it chisels. Sensory impressions ensue like measures induced by this body. The acting body is a subject of art. The searchlight intrudes with much greater intensity. After all, how does new knowledge arise?","","",""

Many of Berchem's projects speak directly about his own life, documenting his progress from the United States to Europe, uncovering his fears and weaknesses and, in doing so, transforming his experience of the world as he tries to play his part in ours. He intrudes in other people's social and/or private lives, and focuses on patterns of behavior. Voyeurism is a key aspect of the work and it often seems that the projects in which he appears are actually attempts to catch a glimpse of himself, to be a voyeur of his own behavior as well as an obsessive watcher of others. \
\
His favorite subjects are banal: (male) sexuality, sports and the arena of life, television. In his texts and slide pieces, his performances, his videos, the TV talk shows and large installations Berchem places himself amongst his audience, and his audience places itself in the center of his work. Essential to the whole process are the discussions about his work and the collaboration with others - colleagues, friends and total strangers - in realizing them. \
\
\"It's Not My Fault\" gives a comprehensive overview of the diversity of Berchem's projects to date. The illustrations are combined with original texts by the artist, comments by participants in his productions, and an introduction by curator Lisette Smits, and a major essay by curator/critic Charles Esche","","",""

The public is able to witness both an artistic departure and a new path sought by the artist. To start with the latter, that is to say the leave-taking: throughout the 1990s Bigum consistently used one figure, a little cloaked man, ART - to personify the concept of art. These are his last pictures involving ART. The figure, with a scythe over his shoulder and with his large nose sticking out from under the monk´s hood, has served as our guide from one picture to another. Art has taken us through a universe of its own, either to offer us new experiences or to wield the scythe once more.' \

The publication brings together photographs and texts from the exhibition along with background information relating to the projects themselves.\

His paintings, sculptures, and site-specific installations are primarily composed of found and manufactured objects. Often employing common, simple materials, his work touches on issues of space, architecture, and memory, with a suggestive power of association that goes beyond the visual to the level of metaphor. Bringing together the viewer's subjective conscience with the greater conscience of everyday life, Cabrita Reis's artworks induce a reconstruction of individual and collective memory, creating an expansion of meaning and proposing a literal and figurative reconstruction of the world. This lavishly illustrated publication provides a comprehensive overview of the artist's work from the mid-80s to the present, and includes writings by the artist as well as bibliography and thumbnail catalogue raisonné.

He made his first picture of his back and hands in 1978 when he was fifty-eight and the last in A Body in 2001, at the age of eight-one. Mythic in scope and unflinching in its examination of one person's humanness and mortality, Coplans transcends, in this sequence of 115 images, the boundaries of photography as an art. A painter by training and a self-taught photographer by choice, Coplans uses his own headless body as his subject matter and as his medium to investigate every inch and idea about his maleness. Epic, grotesque, bittersweet, sensual, provocative, poignant, funny, and even - at times - absurd, Coplans achieves a visual meditation on the compelling relationship beween sensuality, aging, and death that is unparalleled in the history of the medium. While Coplans has published abbreviated versions of his nude portraits in catalogs and small format books, A Body is the first publication to present the full emotional impact of this important work in an oversized monograph that takes the viewer on a protean voyage through, inside, around, and all over the human body","","",""

Those movements marked his artistic beginnings, and thus in his earliest works Cragg started out with found materials, which he stacked, heaped, or spread on to the floor so as to study and analyze their properties. To capture the receptacle forms of vessels and cells--understood as a metaphor for any biological organism--he used traditional materials such as cast iron, bronze, glass, or stone. More recently, his interest has been increasingly directed at converting one idea into numerous variations. For instance, in the Early Forms series, the inner and outer forms become ever more complex; in Rational Beings, the sculptural form becomes ever more volumetric and statuesque. In the end, Cragg's sculptures can never be unambiguously classified; they appear as sensual, poetic creatures, mutable and paradoxical. This present scholarly survey of Cragg's work distinguishes systematic and chronological aspects, reflects on ways of working and material resources, and makes apparent associations, interconnections, and evolutionary strands.

The first solo exhibition in Ireland of the work of the leading New York-based, Irish artist and illustrator Brian Cronin opens to the public at the Irish Museum of Modern Art on Wednesday 1 April. Brian Cronin: Fat Face with Fork comprises some 300 works and ranges from commercial drawings, commissioned by such prestigious publications as The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal and Time, to personal pieces exploring subconscious manifestations of the human condition. Cronin sees this interrelation between his commercial and personal work and the progression of ideas from one body of drawings to the other as key features of his work. “A specific commissioned illustration involves a chain of ideas, which in turn can be taken to a new level of form and meaning in my personal work.” ","","",""

He studied photography at Christer Stromholm's legendary photography school and then graphic design at the Beckman's School of Art. Dawid has been the recipient of numerous awards and artist's grants, and his work has been extensively exhibited internationally, in addition to being included in many public and private collections.\
\
For over thirty years celebrated Swedish artist Dawid has been making series of photographically based artworks examining the nature of the medium and exploring issues of perception. He began doing photographs in the late sixties, documenting incongruous moments with a wry sense of humor, until he established his signature style of stark graphic illustration, initiated with the seminal Rost series. His recent work has utilized the possibilities of digitalization, and this book elaborates the vision of an image-maker whose life's work reflects, criticizes and parallels the checkered history and changing status of photography. This stunningly designed and extensive book constitutes the first comprehensive survey of Dawid's work. The publication will include fictional and factual essays by Michael Mack, considering the artist's influence and context-personal, cultural, and art historical-and exploring the psychological, philosophical and often bizarre depths of his work.","","",""

Static camera positions and long takes are characteristic of her films, creating a sense of stillness in their moving images. Her methods are highly flexible: she allows chance to intervene during the phases of preparation, filming, sound recording, and editing in such a way that she continually finds new directions for her work to take, instead of directing it with rigidity. Her films merge fact and fiction. Both the physical world and our private worlds are depicted, with the relationship between them central to the work. She often employs the coastline and sea as a motif in her work, suggesting a fascination with the elemental idea of the sublime. This first monograph on her work accompanies a show at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona, and will be a welcome introduction to a young artist whose work has earned her significant praise.

Tacita Dean (b. 1965) is an artist internationally known for her compelling work in film. She seeks connections--between history and the present, fact and fiction. Her starting point is typically a chance encounter or discovery. She pursues her investigation like a detective, piecing together evidence and presenting it in a loosely woven, often inconclusive narrative. This book includes an introduction to the artist and her work by Clarrie Wallis, followed by eight responses by writers from diverse backgrounds. The book also contains a full biography, exhibition history, and filmography.","","",""

She entitled the resulting series \"The Omega Suites\", alluding to the final letter of the Greek alphabet as a metaphor for the finality of execution. More than just a critique of the death penalty, Devlin's austere, haunting images extend that critique to an American society in which 70 percent of the citizens support the death penalty. In her photographs, death row and the death chambers are symbolic of American culture and the American psyche. An electric chair in one image, placed in the center of a room amid emptiness and clinical sterility, resembles nothing so much as a throne. Elsewhere, the somber cross-like stretcher used for lethal injections invokes the execution as religious ritual, complete with a captivated audience. Icy and compelling, these photographs paint a clearly defined picture of a world we often choose not to see.","","",""

Willie Doherty (born 1959), a native of Derry, Northern Ireland, is an artist of international standing. He uses photography, video, and sound installations to explore the fallibility of human memory and our collective need to engage with the stories and images that represent our experiences.\
\
 Many of Willie Doherty's photographs suggest a strong potential for narrative development. The viewer, however, is compelled to move beyond the surface of the picture to examine its social, political, psychological, and economic dimensions. Much of his work is open-ended or contingent and questions the truth-telling aspects of visual representation. This midcareer retrospective is the most comprehensive book yet published on this artist.","","",""

His unusual, original color compositions and independent use of forms and materials had a significant influence on artists like Fred Tomaselli and Mathew Ritchie. In Dunham's works, pictorial elements reminiscent of cartoons became recognizable details within an enlivened, abstract picture surface as early as the beginning of the eighties. Later in the decade, Dunham turned to larger formats, painting the expanses of his canvases with visually constant forms in fluid gesture: Bodily shapes, reduced to pictographs, repulsive-looking, hairy and resembling tumours, teeth or lips, in expressionist colors and exhibiting an impressive painterly quality. Recently, his pictures have become distinctly more figurative and show aggressive male and female caricatures, with buildings, planets and boats, too, becoming vehicles of human emotions and unbridled primary energies","","",""

Exploring his native South, he pioneered the use of colour photography, which so far had mainly been used for advertising and magazine work. This work presents a survey of his luminous photographs spanning from 1967 to the present. A kitchen sink, a country road, a girl lying on the grass: Eggleston's deceptively simple images reveal hidden and intricate pleasures of the visible world.

Created by the internationally renowned sculptor Antony Gormley, the Angel is the biggest public sculpture in Britain. This book includes over 200 photographs, alongside reviews and designs that chart the making of the Angel. It explores the way in which Gormley's creative vision and Arup's engineering skills and technical knowledge have combined to make a confidently conclusive sculptural statement. Accompanying the images are essays by the novelist and cultural critic Iain Sinclair, art historians Dr Stephanie Brown and Gail-Nina Anderson, and sociologist Beatrix Campbell, as well as text by Gormley himself and Gateshead Arts Council. Making An Angel is designed by Why Not Associates. \"High production values, eloquent design and revealing essays.\" - Independent on Sunday ","","",""

This new book brings together over 100 images with texts written by James Delingpole, Will Self, Ann Elliott, Benedict Read and Anthony Denselow. \"Nicola Hicks' figurative work is wholly distinctive. It can demonstrate - and overcome - that fundamental challenge of sculpture, the representation of the body in movement in a static format. 'I have a feeling in my head of a piece. It's the feeling of the twist in a dance'.\" B. Read \"I'm the camel that broke the straw's back. I'm the intrusion into everybody's lives that has provoked this odd exodus. In the hateful hollow I dwelt, face down in the cold mulch of leaves and twigs and worms and trundling lice.\" W. Self","","",""

Yet in 1961, he cut down on his artistic activities and began what he called \"the first complete revision of the existing philosophical system\". This text examines three volumes of Jorn's philosophy: \"The Natural Order\" which merged insights from the Copenhagen interpretation of the theory of complementarity and Marxian dialectical materialism into what Jorn called triolectics; \"Value and Economy\" which utilizes for its first section an earlier critique of Marxian economics that also postulates a category of artistic value, whilst the second part outlines the necessary conditions for a \"creative elite\" to take over from the current power elite; and \"Luck and Chance\" from 1953, which places Jorn's ideas about \"extreme aesthetics\" in this context.

Challenging nearly all the prevailing assumptions about the visual arts of his time, he pioneered the postwar revival of collage, photography, silkscreen, technology, and performance.\
\
This book focuses on Rauschenberg?s work during the critical period of the 1950s and 1960s. It opens with a newly prefaced version of Leo Steinberg?s \"Reflections on the State of Criticism,\" the first published version of his famous 1972 essay, \"Other Criteria,\" which remains the single most important text on Rauschenberg. Rosalind Krauss?s \"Rauschenberg and the Materialized Image\" builds on Steinberg?s essay, arguing that Rauschenberg?s work represents a decisive shift in contemporary art. Douglas Crimp?s \"On the Museum?s Ruins\" examines Rauschenberg?s silkscreens in the context of the modern museum. Helen Molesworth?s \"Before Bed\" uses psychoanalytic and economic structures to examine the artist?s Black Paintings of the early 1950s. A second essay by Krauss, \"Perpetual Inventory,\" revisits both her and Steinberg?s articles of nearly twenty-five years earlier. Finally, Branden Joseph?s \"A Duplication Containing Duplications\" views Rauschenberg?s silkscreens in relation to the artist?s interests in technology, particularly television.\
Branden W. Joseph is an associate professor of contemporary art at the University of California, Irvine. He has published on Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, John Cage, Diane Arbus, Buckminster Fuller, Robert Morris, Pat O'Neill, and Anthony McCall. ","","",""

Not a craftsman herself, Gunnel Sahlin brought with her a host of ideas from unrelated disciplines, experimentation that stretched the limits of traditional concepts in glass design. Along with the craftsmen and glassblowers, she created extraordinary works of lasting beauty. Gunnel Sahlin is in several museum collections, including the Museum of Glass in Corning, NY, and has had more than forty individual and group shows in Sweden, Japan, America, England just to name a few.","","",""

Framed in a discussion of the history and intellectual issues surrounding the postmodern movement, the essays in this book uncover how these sculptors have grappled with postmodern doubt, how they adopted it into their work, and succeeded in liberating art forever.

He creates a new taxonomy of his subject, identifying four specific forms - enchantments, impersonations, interventions and rapprochements - and shows how installation art is steering the concept of museums and galleries in new and exciting directions.

He seems so real, so alive, that the viewer believes both he and his fantastical world must somehow exist. But in reality it is not Jack who is the star of the show; it is the over 140 artists and technicians who have spent more than two years bringing Jack and all his friends to life on the screen. Every gesture Jack makes was created by a human hand, by an animator who moved the puppet in tiny increments from frame to frame. Every character, every set, every prop had to be designed and then actually fabricated by someone. This book tells the true story of the film, highlighting the art and the vision that make the movie so memorable.

This text offers a theory of mediation for our digital age that challenges this assumption. They argue that visual media achieve their cultural significance precisely by paying homage to, rivaling, and refashioning such earlier media as perspective painting, photography, film and television. They call this process of refashioning \"remediation\" and they note that earlier media have also refashioned one another: photography remidiated painting, film remediated stage production and photography, and television remediated film, vaudeville and radio. In chapters devoted to individual media or genres (such as computer games, digital photography, virtual reality, film, and television), the authors illustrate the process of remediation and its two principal styles or strategies: transparent immediacy and hypermediacy. Each of these strategies has a long and complicated history. A painting by the 17th-century artists Pieter Saenredam, a photograph by Edward Weston, and a computer system for virtual reality are all attempts to achieve transparent immediacy by ignoring or denying the presence of the medium. A medieval illuminated manuscript, an early 20th-century photomontage, and today's buttoned and windowed multimedia applications are instances of hypermediacy - a fascination with the medium itself. Although these two strategies appear contradictory, they are in fact the two necessary halves of remediation.","","",""

This book investigates the many ideas and issues informing the project, acknowledging the achievements and problems in seeking to develop an artwork that would harness the properties of emergence. The preface by Mike King and essays by Igor Aleksander, Jonathan Mackenzie and Joe Faith provide a critical contextualisation of BIOTICA in relation to scientific research and other art projects in this field. BIOTICA was initially funded by a Sci-Art Award from the Wellcome Trust with development funding from Interval Research Corporation. A major award from Intel Corporation towards the development of real time interactive artworks and funding towards programming support from the Arts Council of England enabled the completion of the BIOTICA project.","","",""

The game console may help to prepare children for participation in the digital world, but at the same time it socializes boys into misogyny and excludes girls from all but the most objectified positions. The new \"girls' games\" movement has addressed these concerns. Although many people associate video games mainly with boys, the girls' games movement has emerged from an unusual alliance between feminists activists (who want to change the \"gendering\" of digital technology) and industry leader (who want to create a girls' market for their games). Contributors explore how assumptions about gender, games, and technology shape the design, development, and marketing of games as industry seeks to build the girl market. They describe and analyze the games currently on the market and propose tactical approaches for avoiding the steroetypes that dominate most toy store aisles. The lively mix of perspective and voices includes those of media and technology, educators, psychologists, industry insiders, and girl gamers.","","",""

Linking artistic practice and critical theory, the annual festival and symposium bring together scientists, philosophers, sociologists and artists in an ongoing discourse on the effects of digital media on creativity - and on culture itself. Since Ars Electronica's inception, the evolution of the artistic, historical and theoretical works presented has been documented in a series of publications that remain crucial to any understanding of media art. Drawing on the abundant and inventive resources of those publications and on Ars Electronica's archives, this anthology collects the essential works that form the core of a contemporary art long dismissed as too technical or inaccessible. The book includes a critical introduction, full bibliography, and texts and artworks from the key figures in the field.

Present-day explorers face new territories born from the coupling of living tissue and metal, strange lifeforms that are intelligent but unconscious, neither completely alive nor dead. Our bodies are now made of machines, images, and information. We are becoming cultural bodies in a world inhabited by cyborgs, clones, genetically modified animals, and innumerable species of human/information symbionts. Ollivier Dyens's \"Metal and Flesh\" is about two closely related phenomena: the technologically induced transformation of our perceptions of the world and the emergence of a cultural biology. Culture, according to Dyens, is taking control of the biosphere. Focusing on the 20th century - which will be remembered as the century in which the living body was blurred, molded, and transformed by technology and culture - Dyens ruminates on the undeniable and irreversible human/machine entanglement that is changing the very nature of our lives.

For a number of years, Ars Electronica has been concentrating on the new artistic horizons opened up by the Information Society. Real ways of life and living situations in a globalized world fed by the continual flow of information are at the center of attention. Commentary on these developments is not only from a technical point of view, but above all from a sociopolitical one. In 1999, Ars Electronica began to fix its thematic focus on the life sciences, and to look into the social and political issues which are accompanying the biological revolution. Ars Electronica, as a festival for art, technology and society, is programmatically committed to exploring the ways in which artists deal with technology-induced social and cultural change, and, as a festival of contemporary art, has been striving since its very inception to make this visible as a form of political work as well.","","",""

Examining a variety of media in their historic contexts, it explores those moments of transition when new media were not yet fully defined and their significance was still in flux. Examples range from familiar devices such as the telephone and phonograph to unfamiliar curiosities such as the physiognotrace and the zograscope. Moving beyond the story of technological innovation, the book considers emergent media as sites of ongoing cultural exchange. It considers how habits and structures of communication can frame a collective sense of public and private and how they inform our apprehensions of the \"real.\" By recovering different (and past) senses of media in transition, \"New Media, 1740-1915\" promises to deepen our historical understanding of all media and thus to sharpen our critical awareness of how they acquire their meaning and power.

PARC’s Artist-in-Residence Program (PAIR) brings artists who use new media to PARC and pairs them with researchers who often use the same media, though in different contexts. This is radically different from most corporate support of the arts, where there is little intersection between the disciplines. The result is both interesting art and new scientific innovations.\
\
Art and Innovation explores the unique process that grew from this pairing of new media artists and scientists working at the frontier of developing technologies. In addition to discussing specific works created during several long-term residencies, the artists and researchers reveal the similarities and differences in their approaches and perspectives as they engage each other in a search for new methods for communication and creativity.\

Katherine Hayles uses the autobiographical persona of Kaye to explore how literature has transformed itself from inscriptions rendered as the flat durable marks of print to the dynamic images of CRT screens, from verbal texts to the diverse sensory modalities of multimedia works, from books to technotexts. Weaving together Kaye's pseudo-autobiographical narrative with a theorization of contemporary literature in media-specific terms, Hayles examines the ways in which literary texts in every genre and period mutate as they are reconceived and rewritten for electronic formats. As electronic documents become more pervasive, print appears not as the sea in which we swim, transparent because we are so asccustomed to its conventions, but rather as a medium with its own assumptions, specificities and inscription practices. Hayles explores works that focus on the very inscription technologies that produce them, examining three writing machines in depth: Talan Memmott's groundbreaking electronic work \"Lexia to Perplexia\", Mark Z. Danielewski's cult postprint novel \"House of Leaves\", and Tom Phillips's artistic book \"A Humument\". Hayles concludes by speculating on how technotexts affect the development of contemporary subjectivity. ","","",""

Some scholars celebrate the proliferation of digital images, arguing that it suggests a return to a pictorial age when knowledge was communicated through images as well as through words. Others argue that the inherent conflict between texts and images creates a battleground between the feminized, seductive power of images and the masculine rationality of the printed word. This text suggests that these debates misunderstand the dynamic interplay that has always existed between word and image. Arguing that new media do not represent a radical rupture from the past, the book examines rhetorical and cultural uses of word and image both historically and currently. It shows that complex, interpenetrating relationships between verbal and visual communication systems were already evident in hieroglyphic writing and in ancient rhetoric and persist in the work of of classical rhetoricians, in cultural studies of technology, even in the binary code distinctions of digital environments. The essays blend theory, critique, and design practice to explore the often contradictory relations of word and image. All of them call for theoretically grounded approaches to hypermedia design.

With interactive media and continuously updated information, communication entails a new, more dynamic set of design problems. In this book Suguru Ishizaki offers a theoretical framework for dealing with the challenges and opportunities of what he calls \"dynamic design\". His approach incorporates a community of collaborating agents that control design solutions in response to a changing context. He illustrates his ideas with several examples, such as expressive e-mail and responsive maps.

Monotheistic religions, scientific theories and contemporary arts have struggled with the contradictory urge to produce and also destroy images and emblems. Moving beyond the image wars \"Iconoclash\" shows that image destruction has always coexisted with a cascade of image production, visible in traditional Christian images as well as in scientific laboratories and the various experiments of contemporary art, music, cinema and architecture. While iconoclasts have struggled against icon worshippers, another history of \"iconophily\" has always been at work. Investigating this alternative to the Western obsession with image worship and destruction allows useful comparisons with other cultures, in which images play a very different role. \"Iconoclash\" offers a variety of experiments on how to \"suspend\" the iconoclastic gesture and to renew the movements of images against any freeze-framing.

Calling himself a radical media pragmatist, Lovink envisions an Internet culture that goes beyond the engineering culture that spawned it to bring humanities, user groups, social movements, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), artists and cultural critics into the core of Internet development. In \"Dark Fibre\", Lovink combines aeshetic and ethical concerns and issues of navigation and usability without ever losing sight of the cultural and economic agendas of those who control hardware, software, content, design and delivery. He examines the unwarranted faith of the cyber-libertarians in the ability of market forces to create a decentralized, accessible communication system. He studies the inner dynamics of hackers' groups, Internet activists, and artists, seeking to understand the social laws of online life. Finally, he calls for the injection of political and economic competence into the community of freedom-loving cyber-citizens, to wrest the Internet from corporate and state control. The topics include the erosion of e-mail, bandwidth for all, the rise and fall of dot-com mania, techno-mysticism, sustainable social networks, the fight for a public Internet time standard, the strategies of Internet activists, mailing lists culture, and collaborative text filtering. Stressing the importance of intercultural collaboration, Lovink includes reports from Albania, where NGOs and artists use new media to combat the country's poverty and isolation; from Taiwan, where the September 1999 earthquake highlighted the cultural politics of the Internet; and from Delhi, where a new media centre explores free software, public access and Hindi interfaces.","","",""

His clear-eyed evaluation of new media includes an impassioned discussion- informed by the discourse of technology, aesthetics, and cultural theory- of the digital artists, designer, and makers who matter most. \"Snap to Grid\" is a command that instructs the computer to take hand-drawn lines and plot them precisely in Cartesian space. Advanced users regularly disable this function the moment they open an application because they value ambiguity and expressiveness more than predictability and accuracy. Lunefeld uses \"snap to grid\" as a metaphor for how we manipulate and think about electronic culture that enfolds us. In this book he snaps his seduction by the machine to the grid of critical thinking. ","","",""

He places new media within the histories of visual and media cultures of the last few centuries. He discusses new media's reliance on conventions of old media, such as the rectangular frame and mobile camera, and shows how new media works create the illusion of reality, address the viewer, and represent space. He shows how catergories and forms unique to new media, such as interface and database, work with the more familiar conventions to make possible a new kind of aesthetic. ","","",""

\
After the novel, and subsequently cinema privileged narrative as the key form of cultural expression of the modern age, the computer age introduces its correlate database. Many new media objects do not tell stories; they don't have a beginning or end; in fact, they don't have any development, thematically, or formally or otherwise which would organize their elements into a sequence. Instead, they are collections of individual items, where every item has the same significance as any other.","","",""

Terms and phrases such as \"the global village\" and \"the medium is the message\" are now part of the lexicon, and McLuhan's theories continue to challenge our sensibilities and our assumptions about how and what we communicate. There has been a notable resurgence of interest in McLuhan's work in the last few years, fuelled by the recent and continuing conjunctions between the cable companies and the regional phone companies, the appearance of magazines such as \"Wired\", and the develoment of new media models and information ecologies, many of which were spawned from MIT's Media Lab. In effect, media now begs to be redefined. ","","",""

Photographs can now be altered at will in ways that are virtually undetectable and photorealistic synthesized images are becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from actual photographs. Continuing William Mitchell's investigations of how we understand, reason about, and use images, \"The Reconfigured Eye\" provides a systematic, critical analysis of the digital imaging revolution. It describes the technology of the digital image in detail and looks closely at how it is changing the way we explore ideas, at its aesthetic potential, and at the ethical questions it raises.

The book opens with 11 essays that approach the social and cultural implications of cyberspace from the perspective of cultural studies, communications, art history, art criticism, English, and women's studies. These are followed by nine virtual environments (along with statements of what the artists are trying to accomplish in both theoretical and technical terms), created over a three-year period as part of the Art and Virtual Environments Project at the Banff Centre. Together, writers and artists examine the consequences in cyberspace for race and identity, materiality and the body, landscape and narrative. Specific implications of the masculinist and rationalist biases of cybespace are also discussed. ","","",""

The extracts are presented in chronological order, beginning with some precursors to cyberspace theory as we know it today. Extracts by early theoreticians such as Charles Babbage or Alan Turing, or writers such as E.M. Forster help to give a historical perspective to the subject.

A final section probes aspects of visual culture in such environments as the evolving museum, movie spectaculars, and \"the virtual window\".

The intimacy of the human-computer interface has made it impossible to distinguish technology from the social and cultural business of being human. Cyberculture is the broader name given to this process of becoming through technological means. This book shows that cyberculture has been a long time coming. In this volume, media critics and theorists, philosophers, and historians of science explore the antecedents of such aspects of contemporary technological culture as the Internet, the World Wide Web, artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, virtual reality, and the cyborg. The contributors examine key texts that anticipate cybercultural practice and theory, including Plato's \"Simile of the Cave\"; the Renaissance Ars Memoria; Descartes's Meditations (on the mind-body split); Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; Alan Turing's Computing Machinery and Intelligence; Philip K. Dick's Man, Android, and Machine; William Gibson's Neuromancer; and Arthur C. Clarke's Profiles of the Future. In the final section, a number of cyberculture artists explore how cybercultural themes have been taken up and critiqued in the electronic arts. ","","",""

General introductions by Janet Murray and Lev Manovich, along with short introductions to each of the texts, place the works in their historical context and explain their significance. The texts were originally published between World War II--when digital computing, cybernetic feedback, and early notions of hypertext and the Internet first appeared--and the emergence of the World Wide Web--when they entered the mainstream of public life. The texts are by computer scientists, artists, architects, literary writers, interface designers, cultural critics, and individuals working across disciplines. The contributors include (chronologically) Jorge Luis Borges, Vannevar Bush, Alan Turing, Ivan Sutherland, William S. Burroughs, Ted Nelson, Italo Calvino, Marshall McLuhan, Billy Kl ver, Jean Baudrillard, Nicholas Negroponte, Alan Kay, Bill Viola, Sherry Turkle, Richard Stallman, Brenda Laurel, Langdon Winner, Robert Coover, and Tim Berners-Lee. The CD accompanying the book contains examples of early games, digital art, independent literary efforts, software created at universities, and home-computer commercial software. Also on the CD is digitized video, documenting new media programs and artwork for which no operational version exists. One example is a video record of Douglas Engelbart's first presentation of the mouse, word processor, hyperlink, computer-supported cooperative work, video conferencing, and the dividing up of the screen we now call non-overlapping windows; another is documentation of Lynn Hershman's Lorna, the first interactive video art installation ","","",""

Indeed, proposes Stephen Wilson, the role of the artist is not only to interpret and to spread scientific knowledge, but to be an active partner in determining the direction of research. Years ago, C.P. Snow wrote about the \"two cultures\" of science and the humanities; these developments may finally help to change the outlook of those who view science and technology as separate from the general culture. In this compendium, Wilson offers a comprehensive survey of international artists who incorporate concepts and research from mathematics, the physical sciences, biology, kinetics, telecommunications, and experimental digital systems such as artificial intelligence and ubiquitous computing. In addition to visual documentation and statements by the artists, Wilson examines relevant art-theoretical writings and explores emerging scientific and technological research likely to be culturally significant in the future. He also provides lists of resources including organizations, publications, conferences, museums, research centers, and Web sites. ","","",""

For $5,000 in circuit boards and high-end editing software, anyone can be a home-office Spielberg. But in 1999, Apple Computer made digital video editing almost as easy as using a word processor--and even less expensive. Built into each of Apple's wildly popular iMac DV computers is the circuitry needed to record pro-quality video from a digital camcorder, and then send the edited movies back to TV or tape with zero picture-quality loss. The crown jewel is the pre-installed editing software: iMovie. Using this cleverly designed program, you can transfer DV footage from camcorder to hard drive; trim and rearrange scenes; and add crossfades, credits, and multiple sound tracks. In fact, iMovie includes almost everything you need to produce pro-quality video--except a manual. That's where iMovie:The Missing Manual comes in. This entertaining guide takes you through every step of iMovie video production, from choosing and using a digital camcorder to burning your finished work onto CDs. The book's philosophy: giving someone iMovie without also teaching basic film technique is like giving a map to a teenager without teaching him to drive. Far deeper and more detailed than the meager set of online help screens included with iMovie, the book helps iMovie users realize the software's potential as a breakthrough in reducing the cost, complexity, and difficulty of desktop video production. The book explains, for example, how to run iMovie on any recent Mac model (not just the iMac DV); uncovers the two secret clip-editing techniques that Apple's online help doesn't even mention; and provides a powerful workaround for iMovie's weak soundtrack-editing feature.

This book examines the relationship between women's fashion, female representation and femininity in Britain throughout the 1900s. The authors unpick the dynamics of the fashion system and set fashion into the context of British social life, using the oral history accounts of women of all classes to highlight the meanings of particular fashions.","","",""

Through formal portraits and candid observation we meet showmen not only at work but also away from their brash, public arena in the private spaces of their living trailers and winter-quarters and during their family celebrations.

It aims to contribute to forming a vision that is global - but not necessarily absolute - of what is already showing itself to be a new architectural action, related to that coined as \"advanced culture\", present in various art disciplines, thought and technology. It talks about an architecture inscribed in the information society and influenced by the new technologies, the new economy, care of the environment and interest in the individual. The diversity of the authors and the special contributions should be seen as an initial decision aimed at promoting the intersecting and collaboration of visions and proposals along these lines.

A great deal of research has focused on the pre- and early history of cinema, but there has been little speculation about a future cinema incorporating new electronic media. Electronic media have not only fundamentally transformed cinema but have altered its role as a witness to reality by rendering \"realities\" not necessarily linked to documentation, by engineering environments that incorporate audiences as participants, and by creating event-worlds that mix realities and narratives in forms not possible in traditional cinema. This hybrid cinema melds montage, traditional cinema, experimental literature, television, video, and the net. The new cinematic forms suggest that traditional cinema no longer has the capacity to represent events that are themselves complex configurations of experience, interpretation, and interaction.\
 This book, which accompanies an exhibition organized by the ZKM Institute for Visual Media, explores the history and significance of pre-cinema and of early experimental cinema, as well as the development of the unique theaters in which \"immersion\" evolved. Drawing on a broad range of scholarship, it examines the shift from monolithic Hollywood spectacles to works probing the possibilities of interactive, performative, and net-based cinemas. The post-cinematic condition, the book shows, has long roots in artistic practice and influences every channel of communication","","",""

It is an inexhaustible mine of anecdotes, quotations, images, curious facts and useless information, oddities, serious science, jokes and memories, all concerned with the interplay between the verbal and the visual, and the limitless resources of the human mind. Loosely arranged in 72 chapters, all this material is presented in a wonderfully inventive series of pages that are themselves masterly demonstrations of the expressive use of type, space, colour and imagery.\
 \
 This book does not set out to teach lessons, but it is full of wisdom and insight collected from all over the world. Describing himself as a visual jackdaw, master designer Alan Fletcher has distilled a lifetime of experience and reflection into a brilliantly witty and inimitable exploration of such subjects as perception, colour, pattern, proportion, paradox, illusion, language, alphabets, words, letters, ideas, creativity, culture, style, aesthetics and value.\
  \
 `The Art of Looking Sideways` is the ultimate guide to visual awareness, a magical compilation that will entertain and inspire all those who enjoy the interplay between word and image, and who relish the odd and the unexpected.       ","","",""

Presenting the work of 114 outstanding contemporary painters in an A-Z sequence, it demonstrates that the medium of painting, far from being conservative and outmoded, is dynamic and flourishing. Vying for attention with forms of art such as installation, video, and performance, this apparently traditional format has continued to atract rising young artists who have continually adapted it to tackle contemporary issues.","","",""

His work is represented in various international collections, including the photography collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\
Urs Stahel, born in 1953, is the director of the Winterthur Fotomuseum and the editor of a number of publications on photography. He lives in Zurich.\
\
The various environments of modern science--genetic engineering, atomic energy, pathology, and animal testing--are the subjects of Hans Danuser's austerely beautiful black-and-white photographs. Recent series included in \"Frost\" push his signature motifs toward abstraction, revealing the microscopic secrets of frozen embryos, the precious yet precarious body fragments of murder victims, and the terrifying beauty of eroded soil. In an accompanying essay, Urs Stahel, director of the Fotomuseum Winterthur, examines the development of Danuser's oeuvre and his persistent investigation of the nexuses of power and knowledge\

While much material art seen in conventional galleries feels disengaged with the world, caught up in weary variations of art-world concerns, Internet art is often humorous, socially aware and politically active. Accessible and jargon-free, this book explores the character of this new, dematerialised online art and the Inernet's transformation into an arena for consumerism. The author, Julain Stallabrass, suggests that Net art may have radical implications for the way in which we think about art's authorship and ownership and more fundamentally, our understanding of what is and what is not art. \
 Julian Stallabrass is lecturer in Art History at the Courtauld Institute of Art, and is author of Gargantua: Manufactured Mass Culture (1996), High Art Lite: British Art in the 1990s (1999) and Paris Pictured (2002)","","",""

 Mona Hatoum was born in Beirut in 1952, to Palestinian parents, and settled in London in 1975. She first became known for a series of performance and video pieces which focused with great intensity on the body. Since the beginning of the 1990s her work has shifted towards installation and sculpture. This book focuses on three new works created for the Tate. Dramatic in scale, Mouli-Julienne (x21), Continental Drift, and Homebound make familiar objects seem foreign, rendering them beautiful yet malevolent. Through the juxtaposition of opposites such as beauty and horror, Hatoum engages the viewer in conflicting emotions of desire and revulsion, fear and fascination.","","",""

The career of Tracey Emin, one of the best-known contemporary British artists, has become a potent symbol of the relationship between art and celebrity in our time. When it was exhibited in London at the Tate in 1999, her now notorious installation \"My Bed\" was denounced by conservative critics as a national scandal, but this and her other work have continued to attract ever larger audiences. Whether storming drunkenly out of live television debates, talking tearfully about her abortions, or modeling evening gowns for Vivienne Westwood, Tracey Emin makes headlines.\
\
Yet if Emin is now universally recognized as a media phenomenon, her work has also begun to attract serious critical attention. In The Art of Tracey Emin, distinguished critics from Britain and the United States address her achievement in depth for the first time, tracing Emin's influences from Egon Schiele to Judy Chicago and establishing her place in a larger tradition of postmodern and feminist art. Adopting a variety of critical approaches, contributors explore the full range of Emin's work, from photography and monoprints to installation art and videos, showing that, however raw and personal it may seem to be, it actually represents a carefully meditated response to vital issues in contemporary culture and society. 50 illustrations.","","",""

His work has transformed critical debates about the status of the image in contemporary culture and influenced an entire generation of younger artists in ways that have not yet been fully acknowledged. Until recently, Coleman has enjoyed relatively little critical attention -- in part because of his refusal to comment on his projects or to allow his work to be reconstructed outside of the context of its exhibition. The illustrated essays in this book span the entirety of Coleman's career to date, from his early postminimal and conceptual experiments with memory and perception, through his work in film, video, and narrative in the 1980s, to his current ongoing series of slide projections with voice-over that he calls simply \"projected images.\" Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the debates induced by Coleman's work, the essays discuss issues of subjectivity and identity, nationalism, postcolonialism, memory, spectacle culture, digitalization, and new media. The contributors are Raymond Bellour, Benjamin Buchloh, Lynne Cooke, Jean Fisher, Luke Gibbons, Rosalind Krauss, Anne Rorimer, and Kaja Silverman. Written by curators, critics, and scholars and spanning the fields of art history, literary criticism, philosophy, and film theory, the essays attest to the interdisciplinary challenge of Coleman's work","","","missing May 2010"

Indeed, the search for illusionary visual space can be traced back to antiquity. In this book Oliver Grau shows how virtual art fits into the art history of illusion and immersion. He describes the metamorphosis of the concepts of art and the image and relates those concepts to interactive art, interface design, agents, telepresence, and image evolution. Grau retells art history as media history, helping us to understand the phenomenon of virtual reality beyond the hype. Grau shows how each epoch used the technical means available to produce maximum illusion. He discusses frescoes such as those in the Villa dei Misteri in Pompeii and the gardens of the Villa Livia near Primaporta, Renaissance and Baroque illusion spaces, and panoramas, which were the most developed form of illusion achieved through traditional methods of painting and the mass image medium before film. Through a detailed analysis of perhaps the most important German panorama, Anton von Werner's 1883 \"The Battle of Sedan\", Grau shows how immersion produced emotional responses. He traces immersive cinema through Cinerama, Sensorama, Expanded Cinema, 3-D, Omnimax and IMAX, and the Head Mounted Display with its military origins. He also examines those characteristics of virtual reality that distinguish it from earlier forms of illusionary art. His analysis draws on the work of contemporary artists and groups ART+COM, Maurice Benayoun, Charlotte Davies, Monika Fleischmann, Ken Goldberg, Agnes Hegedues, Eduardo Kac, Knowbotic Research, Laurent Mignonneau, Michael Naimark, Simon Penny, Daniela Plewe, Paul Sermon, Jefrey Shaw, Karl Sims, Christa Sommerer and Wolfgang Strauss.

They say that a computer does not feel like a toaster or a vacuum cleaner; it feels like a medium that is now taking its place beside other media like printing, film, radio and television. The computer as medium creates new forms and genres for artists and designers; the authors want to show what digital art has to offer to web designers, education technologists, graphic artists, interface designers, HCI experts, and, for that matter, anyone interested in the cultural implications of the digital revolution. In the early 1990s, the World Wide Web began to shift from purely verbal representations to an experience for the user in which form and content were thoroughly integrated. Designers brought their skills and sensibilities to the Web, as well as a belief that a message was communicated through interplay of words and images. The authors argue that invisibility or transparency is only half the story; the goal of digital design is to establish a rhythm between transparency - made possible by mastery of techniques - and reflection - as the medium itself helps us understand our experience of it. This book examines contemporary works in digital art from the Art Gallery of SIGGRAPH 2000. These works, and their inclusion in an important computer conference, show that digital art is relevant to technologists. In fact, digital art can be considered the purest form of experimental design; the examples in this book show that design need not deliver information and then erase itself from our consciousness, but can engage us in an interactive experience of form and content.","","",""

He opens their eyes to new possibilities and invites them to think freshly about future technology. He challenges developers to build products that better support human needs and that are usable at any bandwidth. Shneiderman proposes Leonardo da Vinci as an inspirational muse for the \"new computing\". He wonders how Leonardo would use a laptop and what applications he would create. Shneiderman shifts the focus from what computers can do to what users can do. A key transformation is to what he calls \"universal usability\", enabling participation by young and old, novice and experts, able and disabled. This transformation would empower those yearning for literacy or coping with their limitations. Shneiderman proposes new computing applications in education, medicine, business and government. He envisions a World Wide Med that delivers secure patient histories in local languages at any emergency room and thriving million-person communities for e-commerce and e-government. Raising larger questions about human relationships and society, he explores the computer's potential to support ceativity, consensus-seeking, and conflict resolution. Each chapter ends with a Skeptic's Corner that challenges assumptions about trust, privacy and digital divides. ","","",""

His introduction traces the history of the form, from cave paintings, Chinese silks and Egyptian pyramids to Art Nouveau pochoirs and the Pop art forerunners of stencil art, and then proceeds to a specific history of Stencil Graffiti, tracing its genesis in the Italian fascist propaganda of the 1940s and Basque and Mexican political protests of the 1970s, and examining Stencil Style (typography, functional stencilling, street signage, advertising, decoration). The core of the book is the state of Stencil Graffiti today, from Pop Art to individual street artists' work plus spreads arranged by theme/subject. ","","",""

With this in mind, a group of over seventy A-list celebrities were asked to find and photograph the symbols that give them support – their red crosses.\
Each will approach the project with their own unique vision and perspective, the list includes:- best-selling authors such as Bill Bryson, Nick Hornby and Ian Rankin\
- film stars including Nciole Kidman and Ray Winstone\
- iconic performers such as Mick Jagger, Beth Orton and Marianne Faithful\
- paparazzi savvy celebs including Helena Christensen and Kate Moss\
- Musicians Moby and Natalie Imbruglia\
- designers including Vivienne Westwood and Patrick Cox\
All have been given the chance to be on the other side of the lens and to capture the people, places and symbols that give their lives focus.\
The resulting images will be thought provoking and revealing, as will each of the ‘photographer’s’ accompanying words, written to both explain and critique the image they have taken.\
Part of an ongoing collaboration between Canon and the Red Cross, the projects seek to encourage support for the charity and re-affirm it’s identity and importance.","","",""

The book, a collage of pictures and words, takes the reader into the slum without the mediation of the foreign photographer's eye. The photographs speak eloquently of friends, family, football fever and the harsh realities of everyday life in the slums.

The exhibition draws a parallel between the inherent fragility and strength of glass and the human body. From senses of taste, touch and sight, to exploration of breath, chemical processes, mortality, interior and exterior form the exhibition explores how the body interacts with and is defined by its environment. The use of glass as the meduim for exploring ideas surrounding the body is integral to each work. ","","",""

Bad boys of British art, the Chapman brothers are known as much for their aesthetic of shock and provocation as for their skill as draughtsmen and object makers. \
\
From sculptures and drawings inspired by Goya, to their sexually reconfigured mannequins sporting Nike trainers and the epic sculptural work Hell, the artists create works of weird beauty, horror and excess. The Rape of Creativity is a new body of work presented in the UK for the first time. The exhibition includes sculptures, paintings, drawings, prints and a major installation. Published to accompany the exhibition Jake and Dinos Chapman: The Rape of Creativity held at Modern Art Oxford, 12 April – 8 June 2003.","","",""
