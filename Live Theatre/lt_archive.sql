A two handed small scale tour featuring David Whitaker and the late Sammy (Ronnie) Johnson.  A play about two miners and their experiences as flying pickets during the great strike of 1984/5.  We opened in a small community centre in Middlesbrough and toured to various venues in the mining communities.  It ran for a week at the Gulbenkian Theatre in Newcastle receiving quite favourable reviews.  I have particular fond memories of a couple of speeches written by Tom and delivered by David Whitaker in his best form in the style of and acknowledging Tom Paine.  '),

For this watershed production, I was fortunate enough to work with Tom over a long period when he was at the height of his creative powers.  An ambitious trilogy of short plays that told the story of three generations of a local fishing family, the Robson’s.  Set in and around Cullercoats and North Shields from the turn of the century to 1986.  The show received rave reviews and played to packed houses in the newly opened theatre and subsequently toured extensively throughout the region.  The production featured a stunning debut from Robson Green in the leading role, featuring a headline in the evening chronicle, written by Phil (Poison) Pen fold, that lives long in the memory, ‘It’s green for go in this winner.’  '),

It did feature very fine musical arrangements and original songs by a very talented musical director whose name sadly slips my mind.  The reviews were terrible and audiences appropriately sparce.

Rene and Michael and we quickly came up with the idea of adapting some of these stories to mark the publication of the book IN BLACKBERRY TIME.  Alan’s schedule at that time was, (and remains as ever) incredibly busy and suggested that Michael have a go at adapting, under Alan’s guiding hand, one or two of the stories.  Thus, began two of the theatre’s most important creative relationships.  I have been fortunate enough now to direct or produce about ten of Alan’s plays with one or two more in the pipeline.  I have also been fortunate enough to know Michael from this time collaborating with him on a number of projects over the years.  He currently sits on our board and is an invaluable creative force.  The production featured several of Live Theatre''s senior actors, including Val McLane, David Whitaker and Donald McBride, as well as Robson Green.  A lovely, warm and lyrical piece which enjoyed enormous success and was revived for tours both regionally and nationally.  '),
(1987, 1987, 'COME SNOW COME BLOW ', 'WRITTEN BY LEONARD BARRAS', NULL, NULL, 'Leonard Barras was, in my opinion, one of the country’s greatest absurdist writers.  His unique talents were, sadly, never nationally recognised and I suppose his bizarre sense of humour and context was not to everybody’s taste.  The small scale touring production of this play received somewhat mixed notices and attendances.  To those involved, however, and to every writer and actor who saw it, this play was pure gold and featured Robson’s finest performance to date.  (It also featured his first nude scene.)  And I suppose it’s testament to the quality of the writing that Robson can still recite all his lines: he later produced it as a short film starring Tim Healy.  '),
(1988, 1988, 'KIDDAR’S LUCK    ', 'Adapted from the novels of JACK COMMON, written by Phil Woods', NULL, NULL, 'This was a show which I remembered as one of my favourite productions from the early days of Live Theatre and I was keen to revisit.  Common’s novels, Kidder’s Luck and The Ampersand were seminal examples of early working class novels in the tradition of Lawrence and the later to emerge authors such as Chaplin and Sillitoe.  Phil’s adaptation was robust, lively and comically inspired.  This production also featured Robson Green, Donald McBride, Jan Graveson, and two other actors marking their debut for the company with inspired performances, Denise Welch and Joe Caffrey in the title role.  It toured extensively and I particularly remember a cold night in Whitburn and a drafty school hall, where the Guardian’s correspondent Robin Thornber, sat shivering along with the rest of a small huddled audience of about eighty.  It mustn’t have been that bad because a couple of days later, we got a fantastic review, and probably the only time a national newspapers reviewer had visited the small Wearside coastal town.'),

One company of actors featured in both plays with me directing Tom’s and the late Ken Hill directing Arthur’s piece.  John Blackmore was the executive producer.  A cops and robbers theme, Tom’s play, set in a prison, was another fantastic piece of writing and a heart felt eulogy to the incarcerated and disenfranchised.  A moving, educated and enlightening examination of the lives of those lost to the world of crime and punishment, and a system that struggles to cope with it.  It featured several fantastic stories including the tale of Judith Ward, the M62 ‘bomber’ falsely convicted and eventually freed after serving twenty odd years of a life sentence.  Tom was later to use many other stories he had collected during his time as a writer in residence in northern prisons.  Arthur McKenzie’s piece, penned from his experiences as a Tyneside cop for over twenty years, and was a rugged examination of the seedier side of crime and law enforcement.  The plays worked well together and enjoyed much critical and popular success.   '),
(1988, 1988, 'YOU GOT ME SINGIN’ THE BLUES ', 'WRITTEN BY STEVE CHAMBERS', NULL, NULL, 'Steve Chambers was resident writer at Live Theatre during this time, and the play was produced in partnership with the BRUVVERS Theatre Company.  Steve later went on to become a permanent writer in residence at the BRUVVERS.  SINGIN THE BLUES was at that time a ground breaking examination of the world of mental health and in particular told the story of a number of souls diagnosed as schizophrenic.  Both funny and disturbing, the piece played both Live Theatre and toured extensively.  The opening night at Live was an appropriately bizarre experience whereby a member of the audience, who Steve had talked with during his research, leapt up onto the stage demanding that, as the play was reflecting his experience, he should feature as a member of the cast.  On reflection, he may have had a point but at the time it seemed a somewhat scary and appropriately edgy experience where illusion and reality collided. '),
(1989, 1989, 'BANDITS ', 'WRITTEN BY C.P.TAYLOR', NULL, NULL, 'People will be aware that the Live Theatre space is dedicated to the memory to C.P.Taylor, a writer who along with Tom Hadaway had done much to shape the identity and forge the credibility of the theatre company as a whole.  Sadly, Cecil’s untimely death in 1984 deprived the region, indeed the country, and certainly Live Theatre of one of its supreme creative talents.  To acknowledge this, the company decided to collaborate with a number of other organisations that Cecil had worked with to present a festival of his work.  BANDITS was chosen as the flagship production of the festival, a play that I had appeared in as a student when first working with Cecil in 1979, later produced by the RSC and also by Live Theatre Company in 1982.  From a personal point of view I was never satisfied with the show and, in many ways, felt that the youth theatre production I had directed before becoming the artistic director of Live Theatre, was a much better realisation of the play.  The production also toured into Scotland as well as the north east.'),
(1989, 1989, 'PIGEON MAN', 'WRITTEN BY TOM HADAWAY', NULL, NULL, 'Another revival of an old Live Theatre play, a warm and touching story of a fish curer and pigeon fancier, and his hapless assistant set in a smoke house in North Shields.'),
(1989, 1989, 'HAIR IN THE GATE ', 'WRITTEN BY MICHAEL CHAPLIN', 'DESIGNED BY JOHN PERRY HUDSON', NULL, 'This was Michael Chaplin’s first play following his collaboration with Alan Plater on IN BLACKBERRY TIME.  We were fascinated by the story told to us by T Dan Smith of an apprentices strike in the shipyards during the Second World War, of which Dan was one of the leaders.  Michael decided to weave a fictional story of a film maker coming back to Tyneside to make a movie for the Ministry of Information, with the intention of inspiring the workers to contribute to the war effort.  The two instances seemed an appropriate conflict to form the crucible of a historical political drama.  Michael also unearthed a fascinating story of local government corruption scandal during the war on Tyneside involving the inappropriate use of petrol coupons by local government officials.  The film maker was loosely based on Jack Common who had indeed penned screenplays for such films, including A TYNESIDE STORY.  A clip from this film incidentally was used as the prologue to our last production in the old Live Theatre space; A NIGHTINGALE SANG by C.P.Taylor.  The production saw two dazzling debuts for the company, from Deka Walmsley and Charlie Hardwick.  '),

The Guardian’s Peter Mortimer accused Steve of plagiarism, a point that still irks both Steve and I, as it seemed to fundamentally miss the point.  The show played to sell out audiences and was an immensely enjoyable romp.  The show featured superb performances from Deka Walmsley, Libby Davison and Phillippa Wilson.   '),

(1990, 1991, 'GREEN FINGERS ', 'WRITTEN BY MICHAEL WILCOX', 'DESIGNED BY NIGEL HOOK', NULL, 'Another collaboration with the Newcastle Playhouse.  These three new pieces were presented in a season of work coming out of Newcastle.  I seem to recall Andrew McKinnon, the artistic director at the Newcastle Playhouse, directed Rod’s pieces and I directed Michael’s.  It was an ambitious season very favourably received.  We had an interesting ensemble of actors made up of both Live regulars, Deka Walmsley took the lead in WOYZECK, Rod’s hard hitting adaptation.  I recall an excellent design with Live being transformed into a traverse playing space.  Colin MacLachlan featured in two of the productions as did Donald McBride.  Denise Welch and Tracy Wilkinson performed HIGH BRAVE BOY, a superbly taught two-hander.  GREEN FINGERS featured the debut of Peter Peverly and there were great performances from Donald and Colin and an older Scottish actor called Roy Hanlon.  Michael Wilcox had been a close associate of Cecil Taylor who had done much to encourage Michael’s early work.  He had gained much success at the Traverse theatre with his plays RENTS and ACCOUNTS and was editor for the publisher Methuens ‘gay plays’ series.  GREEN FINGERS transferred to the Kings Head Theatre, London.'),
(1991, 1991, 'NORTHERN GLORY  ', 'WRITTEN BY PHIL WOODS', 'DESIGNED BY JOHN PERRY HUDSON', NULL, 'I have to say that if I had a top five of favourite plays and experiences connected to those plays, NORTHERN GLORY would be a leading contender to top the list.  Somehow, we were asked to celebrate the centenary of the Northern football league.  The league had been formed in the late nineteenth century by coal miners, shipyard and iron workers in Northumberland and Durham.  There were some amazing stories including West Auckland amateur football club winning the very first world cup tournament in Turin in the early 1900’s, the legendary Bishop Auckland winning a record number of FA amateur cups and the awesome 1955 final between Bishop Auckland and Crook Town, two small mining towns in County Durham less than ten miles apart, who took a hundred thousand supporters down to Wembley for the final where they drew 2-2.  The replay at a packed St. James’ Park also ended in a draw, with Bishops eventually winning the third replay at another sold out Ayresome Park, Middlesbrough, 4-3.  Strangely enough the scorer of five goals in these epic encounters was a young man called Ray Oliver, a coble fisherman form Cullercoats who had been snapped up by the Bishop’s from Whitley Bay.  I had the privilege to meet Ray during my research into the local fishing industry for another play, THE LONG LINE by Tom Hadaway.  The show toured to many of the social and football clubs and community centres in the small towns and villages active in the league, including Bishop Auckland, Crook and West Auckland where the club allowed us to use the actual world cup in the show.  A wonderful cast was lead by Mike Elliott, the well known North East comedian of that time, as well as David Whitaker, Joe Caffrey, Deka Walmsley and a very young Jan Graveson who played, amongst other characters, a young Bob Paisley.  It was one of the most successful and joyous community tours the company ever undertook and received sensational reviews.  Although the play was ostensively about football, it also provided a remarkable insight into a somewhat hidden aspect of the regions rich social history.  '),
(1991, 1992, 'GOING HOME ', 'WRITTEN BY ALAN PLATER', 'DESIGNED BY NIGEL HOOK', NULL, 'Following the success of the collaboration between Live and the soon to be retitled Northern Stage, it was decided that a further collaboration should take place, this time at the Newcastle Playhouse.  Alan wrote his story following an adventure he’d undertaken as a writer in residence in an Australian University.  The show told the story of an exiled Geordie returning from Australia to Tyneside, thirty years after he had emigrated: an effective devise for Alan to examine the change that was affecting the region following the decline of Tyneside as a predominantly heavy industrial region.  The show starred Tim Healy, and it was here that he first met his future wife, Denise Welch, who also featured in the show.  As Alan and I both had a passion for Jazz, we decided to approach Ian Carr to both compose an original score and lead a live band to play it (Lewis Watson featured superbly on Tenor Sax.)  It was a fantastic piece of music entitled Old Heartland, a suite of jazz sketches evoking the spirit and landscape of Tyneside and County Durham.  The show completely sold out the Playhouse and was subsequently produced on a short number one tour by Tim Flood, the administrator of the Playhouse at that time who now sits on our board.  '),
(1991, 1992, 'YOUR HOME IN THE WEST', 'WRITTEN BY ROD WOODEN', NULL, NULL, 'A remarkable play that won both the Mobil New Play Award and the John Whiting Award in 1991.  This searing and powerful drama was based on Rod’s experience as a probation officer in the west end of Newcastle.  It featured a debut for Live of Trevor Fox who, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career as the brutal, dangerous and tragic Micky.  Charlie Hardwick again producing a performance of immense intensity played his estranged and tormented, yet ultimately empowered, wife.  Robson Green also featured in Live’s original production as did a very young Sharon Percy, who also debuted along with Pauline Moriarty and Kirron Hocking.  It was all played out on a wonderfully designed set by John Perry Hudson.  Following its initial run at Live, the show was revived and toured regionally and nationally. '),
(1991, 1992, 'LONG SHADOWS ', 'WRITTEN BY TOM HADAWAY', 'DESIGNED BY NIGEL HOOK', NULL, 'LONG SHADOWS was a follow on from Tom’s work as a writer in residence in Northern prisons and the subsequent play, YESTERDAY’S CHILDREN.  During his spell in this role he had met a young woman from Palestine called Khloud, imprisoned for her attempts to assassinate an Iraqi ambassador in London.  Incarcerated in Durham’s notorious ‘she’ wing, Khloud told Tom amazing stories about her country and her entry into the world of resistance and terror.  Following her release, Tom visited her in the Lebanon as part of his research into this play.  I had come across a story of a young man from South Shields called Ian Davidson, who had joined the Palestine Liberation Organisation and had been imprisoned in Tunisia following capture in a failed kidnapping of alleged ‘Mossad’ agents in Nikocia.  On his research mission to the Middle East, Tom had also managed to set up a meeting with Davidson and his story formed a loose narrative structure for Tom to create his remarkable play.  I remember how difficult it was to cast the play, as finding young Arab actresses proved extremely difficult.  We took the decision to ask a young Jewish actress to take on the role of the character loosely based on Khloud.  Given the subject matter, this was an extremely demanding and, at times difficult, process.  Indeed one actress from a Jewish background withdrew from the play.  Deka Walmsley played the character based on Davidson and Colin MacLachlan, Eve Bland and a young Greek actor, whose name slips my mind sadly, completed the ensemble.  The play was one of the bravest and most challenging productions ever presented by Live with Tom writing at the very peak of his considerable powers, creating an angry and passionate drama that also contained some of his most lyrical language and wisest profundity.    '),
(1992, 1992, 'A PROPER JOB ', 'WRITTEN BY MICHAEL CHAPLIN', 'DESIGNED BY JOHN PERRY HUDSON', NULL, 'This was a loosely biographical story, based on Donald McBride’s childhood memories of Fencehouses, County Durham, and his entry into the professional world of acting.  A three hander that also featured David Whitaker and Sue Elliott.   '),
(1993, 1993, 'SEA FARERS', 'WRITTEN BY TOM HADAWAY', NULL, NULL, 'Another play and experience that would be high up the list of favourites.  Commissioned to coincide with the second arrival of the tall ships on the quayside, Tom decided to create two short plays linked by a seafaring theme.  Play One, THE MAN FROM BARBADOS, was set on the fish quay in 1930’s North Shields.  The play told the story of a Cypriot immigrant, Khristos, who had fled the conflicts between Turkey and Greece that had violently divided his homeland and settled in North Shields.  Against the odds he had created a successful business as a ships chandler and had married a local woman who had known great hardship as a former prostitute on the infamous Low Street in Shields.  The character was based on a real guy that Tom had known as a youngster in North Shields who had shown great kindness to Tom during his early years when he was tragically orphaned at four years of age.  Tom had always remembered his warmth and generosity yet had sensed a great sadness that lay behind his eyes and in his soul.  Taking this as his inspiration, Tom told the story of a Bahjan sailor arriving in North Shields with news of Khristos’s estranged son’s tragic drowning.  The traveller eventually manages to expose the truth behind the son’s departure and the devastating effect that his father’s marriage had on the father and son dynamic.  Eventual redemption and reconciliation ensues through the enigmatic actions of the stranger.  A beautifully written piece with a wonderful musical score created and performed by Ivan Sears.  The show featured uniformally wonderful performances from Tim Healy, Trevor Fox, Charlie Hardwick, Phillippa Wilson, Colin MacLachlan and Trevor Laird.  Play Two, THE MAN FROM SHIELDS: this time the setting was a 1950’s penitentiary in Florida.  Tim Healy played a bigoted McCarthyite prison governor, and Trevor Fox played a young Socialist sailor based on the real life character of Jim Slater, a South Shields seaman who became the leader of the National Union of Seamen.  The play was based on a story that Jim had told us, of how as a young man he had been arrested as a Communist sympathiser, whilst serving on a Yugoslavian vessel off the Florida coast.  The fact that Jim had a Geordie accent, and was on an East European ship, had somewhat hampered his claim to innocence along with a very unsupportive British consulate who knew of Jim’s union activity.  Jim eventually finds freedom through a plan hatched by his fellow cons and cellmates.  During rehearsals, Jim Slater sadly passed away and the production was dedicated to his memory and life’s work.      '),
(1993, 1993, 'PORPOISE ASHORE ', 'WRITTEN BY TOM HADAWAY', NULL, NULL, 'Tom Hadaway was remarkable man. Born in North Shields in 1923, he was orphaned at four years of age following the death of his mother from pulmonary tuberculosis and the desertion of his father, William Hunter.  He was taken in by his Aunt Mable who was married to a North Shields fish merchant by the name of Tom Hadaway, which Tom was later to take as his own.  After doing well at school, he eventually found employment as a clerk to a shipping agent on Newcastle’s quayside before the Second World War saw him join the navy and see active service principally during the liberation of Italy.  He returned to Shields after the war to find that although his job was still open, the rate of pay remained pitifully low and, furthermore, his adoptive fathers fishing business had fallen into decline.  He then made the decision to try and resurrect the business and was to spend the next thirty five years building up a highly successful trade as a fish merchant with two busy shops in central North Shields and investments in a several small trawlers.  It wasn’t until about 1974 that he began to write, a talent he had always harboured but never had the time to indulge.  Then, one day, he witnessed a group of fisherman land a porpoise at North Shields fish quay which had become ensnared in their nets.  The men, and we are talking about seasoned hardened fishermen here, were taken aback by the poor beasts beauty and its struggle to survive.  They decided to have a whip round to replace the fishermen’s nets and then collectively cut the creature free and gently released it back to the river where it sped its way back to the ocean.  Tom decided to go home that day and write the experience down. It was eventually published in the Newcastle Journal.  This brought him to the attention of several people who were to encourage him to write a deal more.  Amongst them was the playwright C.P.Taylor, who was to become Tom’s mentor.Tom’s first great success as a playwright came when he wrote THE FILLETING MACHINE a short play that was subsequently filmed by the BBC. Murray Martin, who had founded the film collective, Amber Films, was soon encouraging Tom to write more drama and decided to introduce Tom to the fledgling Live Theatre Company, who subsequently toured a production of THE FILLETING MACHINE to pubs, working mens clubs, social clubs, schools and community centres throughout the north east.  Further plays were to follow, including THE PIGEON MAN and a stage version of his BAFTA winning film, directed by Jack Gold for the BBC, GOD BLESS THEE JACKIE MADISON.  The relationship with Live Theatre was to sustain until his passing in 2004 and a fabulously diverse body of work remains as an important regional cultural legacy.  I firmly believe that Tom was one of the finest dramatists this country has produced and if he had been seen and reviewed in London, his name would be remembered as a major playwright; a statement I know would be supported by a host of writers who were touched by his work.  The fact that he lived and worked in his beloved home town of North Shields, and had no interest whatsoever in courting acceptance from those voices that shape the somewhat bourgeois metropolitan culturally-led agendas that determine success, was in many ways indicative of the man, his integrity and priorities. He possessed a fierce loyalty to the working class community from where he originated and his plays are an unashamed eulogy to the Worlds poor, oppressed and marginalised.  His wisdom, profundity and wry sense of humour will be greatly missed by Live Theatre Company and its audiences here in the North East. Furthermore, his humanist belief in the potential of mankind to love, nurture and collaborate with each other for the common good was and remains an integral component of the history and identity of Live Theatre Company.'),
(1993, 1993, 'UP AND RUNNING ', 'WRITTEN BY PHIL WOODS', NULL, NULL, 'A follow up to NORTHERN GLORY, this piece was commissioned by Durham County Council to tell the story of County Durham.  The show featured a new musical score of songs and lyrics written by the late Alan Hull, of Lindisfarne fame, and a great set of songs they were too.  The cast included Mike Elliott once again and Brendan Healy as performer and musical director.  It was quite interesting to tell the story of a place and its people particularly a place with such a rich and diverse history.  And I remember the problem Phil had with what to include and what to leave out.  The story of Bedes journey to Durham and the establishment of its wonderful cathedral through to the gradual and expansion of one of the worlds largest coalfields featured prominently, as did somewhat more humble but equally resonant personal stories including the story of private wakenshaw of the Durham light infantry and his bravery that saw him gain a posthumous Victoria Cross at the battle of El Alamain.

The audiences shared the embarrassment of Phillippas character as her mother and elder friends hosted an evening of demonstrations and discussions around the activity of sex.

Alan’s seminal play had been first produced at the Dame Flora Robson Theatre in Jesmond and subsequently for a brief run in London’s West End.  This slightly updated version by Alan, as well as playing the venue, toured extensively throughout the region playing to packed houses throughout.  Audiences who although no longer directly associated to the industry could almost exclusively relate to the story as their ancestry was inevitably connected to coalmining and the communities that surrounded the activity.

The setting, a somewhat run down social club, contained several ex-coalminers, shipyard workers and craftsmen alongside their fully employed and breadwinning wives.  The show seemed to capture the very zeitgeist of times and featured a specially commissioned short film projected onto a large screen that told a somewhat nostalgic and rose tinted history of the past in the tradition of the filmmaker John Ford from whose quotation the show took its title.  The film was accompanied by the Felling Silver Band who appeared in their full glory at the end of the play in a stunning coup de’teatre.

The planning of the show, of course, was taking place at a time when Newcastle were ten points clear and we gambled that the production would be an integral part of some major city wide and region wide celebrations.

An extremely ambitious project, some two to three years in the making, that as the title suggests presented a cycle of twelve new plays in two parts presented over two evenings, and in its entirety over Sunday afternoons and evenings of its run. The project was designed to tell the story of a place, its past, present and future at a time when Tyneside and the region as a whole was re examining and re shaping itself in a post industrial economic and cultural landscape.  The process from a directors point of view necessitated a close creative relationship with the projects editorial director Peter Flannery whereby some of Live’s senior and experienced writers worked side by side with some of the regions new and emerging writers.  A highly creative forum was established whereby writers were able to share ideas and responses to the brief in a collective spirit of trust and support so often absent from the writers rather solitary usual experience.  Whilst there was a certain historical chronology to the production, we strived to bring a unique and contemporary theatricality to a classical Jacobean structure in its aims and ambitions.  Namely, to create ‘public plays,’ popular and accessible in style, that were directly relevant to the regions shifting social, political and cultural context that spoke directly and personally to its people.  The style and content sought to be rich in terms of language, bold and vivid in terms of theme and metaphor and simple, slick, yet innovative in production value. The stories and subject matters could not have been more diverse.  Flannery created two pieces, one a prologue that brought the ghost of T Dan Smith into conflict with Sir John Hall, and another that told the story of the great fire of Newcastle in 1854.  Tom Hadaway penned a beautifully lyrical story that told how a baby was washed away along the Tyne at the time of the great flood in 1771.  Kitty Fitzgerald wrote French Revolutionary Jean Paul Marets residence on Tyneside, whilst Shaun Prenderghast wrote two pieces that took the story of Bessie Surtees elopement, set in 17??, aswell as the story of a contemporary shipyard worker who, despite loosing his job, denied the fact to his wife and family.  Emily Woof created a play set in the Bigg Market and Marbella about a young arsonist.  Julia Darling revealed a hidden history in her tale of two elderly women shipyard workers who used to paint ships.  Leonard Barras created a wonderful series of surreal interjections ranging from Roman times to 1930’s Wallsend.  Lee Hall made an unforgettable professional debut as a playwright with his wild philosophical farce, based on Ludwig Wittgenstein’s stay on Tyneside during World War Two.  Mike Chaplin produced the epilogue that saw an elderly engineer who had worked on the construction of the Tyne Bridge and an encounter with a young trapeze artist set to swing from the bridge and its fireworks and fanfares, as the city entered a new millennium. The project, which won a Northern Arts Outstanding Achievement Award, did much to reaffirm and re-evaluate the policy and mission of the company as the region and the country entered a new and uncertain, but nonetheless exciting, phase of its history.  It perhaps drew a highly respectful and acknowledging line under the company’s previous body of work, but also acted as a catalyst for change and realignment of artistic and cultural agendas that faced the theatre company and the region as a whole. The new Live Theatre building was the first arts organisation to emerge from the redevelopment of the quayside at that time, which now sees a cultural quarter encompassing music, art and performance at the very heart of the cities economic and cultural regeneration.  The pioneering early work of Live Theatre, and significantly Amber Films, had sought to establish the rich social and political history of the region as an important literary and cultural stimulus for creative endeavour, for and about the people of the region.  This period of the company’s history and perhaps this production in particular marked a kind of validation of the work to date and an important template as to how art and particularly theatre should respond to the times and concerns of a distinctive place and people that faced a future of the uncertainty of change but the exciting challenge of opportunity.

We worked for a couple of weeks with the actors, Trevor Fox, Charlie Hardwick, Joe Caffrey and Sharon Percy, workshopping the script, and discussing its potential development and expansion.  Following these sessions, Lee would then write in the evening and present us daily with new material that had crystalised and transformed our ideas.  We then subsequently gave the piece a rehearsed reading and realised we had something of enormous potential.  The script was wildly imaginative and quite surreal.  It was in turn literally side splitting in its hilarity and gut wrenching in its tragedy.  Despite the limited resources available to the company at that time, we subsequently undertook an initial production, (I recall we could only afford a two and a half week rehearsal period.)  Chris Connell came in for Trevor, who probably had some television commitment, and the fusion of Lee’s sensational script and the music of Elvis Prestley delivered masterfully by Joe Caffrey, supported by the musical direction of Jim Kitson and a wonderfully creative design by Imogen Cloet and superb lighting by Malcolm Rippeth, gave us one of the biggest hits the company has ever been involved with.  The show went to the Edinburgh festival (with Trevor Fox taking over from Chris Connell), where it received sensational reviews and the Best Comedy at the Fringe Awards and played to packed audiences at the assembly rooms and was subsequently produced by Adam Kenwright into the West End at the Whitehall Theatre, where it received an Olivier Best Comedy nomination.

You are a schmuck.  We are all schmucks.  We are life’s schmucks who have somehow… some fucking how ended up in this mess.”The setting was a rundown porn cinema in 1960’s Gateshead where two Jewish brothers are at war with each other and struggle to organise their hapless Geordie wannabe gangster employees.  Their business is on the verge of bankruptcy and they owe money to a local gangster but all their problems seem to be over, when one of them kidnaps Reg Kray.
