Open plaques is an open database with historical links between people and places, as recorded by commemorative plaques. They have a new API that is briefly documented at http://openplaques.org/about/data and a full database can be downloaded from http://dl.dropbox.com/u/21695507/openplaques/plaques_20120320.xml . The site content is also machine readable in XML and JSON by adding .xml or .json to the page. http://openplaques.org/plaques/9008.json for example.
